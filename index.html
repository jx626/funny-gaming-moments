                   <div>My gaming experience started when I was around five, playing CS with my dad. I was incredibly good at that time, hiding at the mouth of a tunnel with an AWP. Till today on our PC there's a small piece of tape at the center of the screen with a red dot on it. That's what we used to practise no-scoping.</div> 
            
                   <p>Since then gaming has been a mixed blessing. Loads of quarrels it leads to but also carried me through some hard times, and eventually landed me on my current job. One thing never changed is that it has always been nothing short of fun, thanks to all the devs and localisation teams!</p>
